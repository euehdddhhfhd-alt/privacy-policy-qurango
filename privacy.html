    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hi — this page explains, in plain language, what we collect about you, why we collect it, and how you can make choices about your data.</p>
  </section>
<section>
    <h2>What we collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only what we need to run the app:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Automatic info:</strong> basic technical details like which pages you visit and device info — usually used in aggregate to help improve the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Ad data:</strong> ad partners (such as Google AdMob) may use identifiers to deliver and measure ads.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

<section>
    <h2>Ads</h2>
    <p>We use Google AdMob to show ads. Ad partners may use advertising identifiers to deliver and measure ads.</p>
    <p>If you prefer not to see personalized ads, you can adjust your advertising settings in your Android device settings. You can also manage identifiers in your device settings.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Third parties</h2>
    <p>We use Google AdMob to display ads. At the moment we do not include separate analytics libraries like Google Analytics — only ad partners may collect ad-related data.</p>
  </section>

<section>
    <h2>How we use your information</h2>
    <p>In short: to run the app and to make it better. Specifically, we use information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fix bugs and improve app content and speed.</li>
      <li>Show ads so we can fund development.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may share data with service providers who help us analyze traffic or deliver ads. These providers have their own privacy policies.</p>
  </section>

<section>
    <h2>Your choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Opt out of personalized ads:</strong> Use your Android device settings to opt out of personalized advertising.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>If we make important changes, we’ll update the date at the top and post the new version here. We encourage you to check this page from time to time.</p>
